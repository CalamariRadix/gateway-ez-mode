- Improve tests with more coverage and compile-time type assertions to make sure type inference is working as expected.
- Remove redundant file which used to hold some examples (programmatic-json.ts) and move the examples to the main test file (index.test.ts).
- Updated return type of safeParse to use neverthrow.
